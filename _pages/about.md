I received my MS in Artificial Intelligence from Shahrood University of Technology in 2023. I also hold a bachelor’s degree from Zand Institute of Higher Education, which I completed in 2021. Additionally, I have multiple hardware degrees with grade A from the Iran Technical and Vocational Organization.

**About Me**

I care a lot about my discipline and love to explore and learn new things. I push myself to watch different courses for at least one hour daily on LinkedIn, Coursera, YouTube, and other platforms. I also dedicate one hour each day to learning new languages (Japanese at the moment) and one hour to working on different projects and coding. I believe these activities help me keep my brain active and my mind sharp.

My primary research interests include:

	•	Machine Learning
	•	Computer Vision
	•	Image Analysis
	•	Object Detection
	•	HRI
