I care a lot about my discipline and love to explore and learn new things. I push myself to watch different courses for at least one hour daily on LinkedIn, Coursera, YouTube, and other platforms. I also dedicate one hour each day to learning new languages (Japanese at the moment). I believe these activities help me keep my brain active and my mind sharp.
