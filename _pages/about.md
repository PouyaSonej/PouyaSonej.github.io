I am a passionate researcher in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). My research focuses on advancing computer vision through machine learning, with applications in image analysis, object detection, and environmental monitoring. 

I received my MS in Artificial Intelligence from Shahrood University of Technology in 2023. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering with a focus on software, which I completed at Zand Institute of Higher Education in 2021. Additionally, I have multiple hardware certifications with grade A from the Iran Technical and Vocational Organization.

**About Me**

I care a lot about my discipline and love to explore and learn new things. I push myself to watch and explore different courses for at least one hour daily on LinkedIn, Coursera, YouTube, and other platforms. Additionally, I spend an hour each day learning new languages—currently focusing on Japanese—and another hour working on various projects and coding. I believe these activities keep my mind sharp and my skills up-to-date.

**Research Interests**

My primary research interests include:

	•	Machine Learning
	•	Computer Vision
	•	Image Analysis
	•	Object Detection
	•	HRI
 

**Publications and Projects**

*Hybrid Diabetic Retinopathy Detection and Feature Extraction*

In this publication, I have introduced two novel filters using mathematical morphology.

After applying my filters and accompany it with a preprocessing pipeline, I have combined two traditional method and introduced a more advanced one for detecting OD and used V-GAN for detecting BV. Finally, I have explored all automated classification models from traditional to the state-of-art. 

news: At the moment, we are writing our experiments. We plan to submit this publication on the last week of December.

**Contact**

I am always open to collaborations, discussions, and new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via email: pouyasohnej@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn or Github.

Thank you for visiting my website! I hope you find my work interesting, and I look forward to engaging with the academic community and beyond.
