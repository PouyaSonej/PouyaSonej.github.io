I am a passionate researcher in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). My research focuses on advancing computer vision through machine learning, with applications in medical image analysis, object detection, and environmental monitoring. I am particularly interested in enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks.

I received my MS in Artificial Intelligence from Shahrood University of Technology in 2023. I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering with a focus on software, which I completed at Zand Institute of Higher Education in 2021. Additionally, I have multiple hardware certifications with grade A from the Iran Technical and Vocational Organization.

**About Me**

I care a lot about my discipline and love to explore and learn new things. I push myself to watch different courses for at least one hour daily on LinkedIn, Coursera, YouTube, and other platforms. Additionally, I spend an hour each day learning new languages—currently focusing on Japanese—and another hour working on various projects and coding. I believe these activities keep my mind sharp and my skills up-to-date.
