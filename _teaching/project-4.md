This project showcases a classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with regularization techniques to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.
It provides an example of deep learning applied to image recognition tasks with intermediate-level neural network structures. Explore the code and visualizations in this GitHub repository.
