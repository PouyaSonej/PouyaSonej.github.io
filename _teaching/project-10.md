This project is based on standford's computer vision course.
KITTI is a dataset for autonomous driving developed by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. It is a collection of images and LIDAR data used in computer vision research, such as stereo vision, optical flow, visual odometry, 3D object detection, and 3D tracking.
In this project, for semantic segmentation I trained a U-net with imagenet weights on Kittie dataset.

You can access the code and images in this GitHub repository.
