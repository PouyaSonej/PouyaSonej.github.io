This project, based on Stanford’s computer vision course, utilizes the KITTI dataset—a collection of images and LIDAR data for autonomous driving research.

The focus is on semantic segmentation, where a U-Net model pre-trained on ImageNet is fine-tuned on the KITTI dataset. This approach aims to enhance the model’s ability to interpret complex driving scenes. The code and images are available in this GitHub repository.
