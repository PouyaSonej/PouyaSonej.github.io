In this project, CVZONE is used to detect and draw borders around a face, followed by the application of a mesh detector with a limit of detecting one face (maximum faces = 1).

This setup demonstrates a combination of face detection and facial mesh analysis for precise facial feature mapping. The code is available for exploration in this GitHub repository.

By detecting face features, I made a circle used cv2 and placed it at the center of each eye.
This project is available for both video and image. This code can be used for real time detection too.
