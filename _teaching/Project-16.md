This project uses CVZONE to enable mouse control through hand gestures. 
The system tracks the tip of the index finger to move the mouse pointer on the screen. A “click” action is triggered when the thumb touches the tip of the index finger, simulating a mouse click. This project highlights the integration of hand gesture recognition with interactive computing. 
The code is available for exploration in this GitHub repository.
