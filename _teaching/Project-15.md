This project leverages CVZONE to detect a hand and recognize finger gestures for controlling volume. 
By tracking the thumb and index finger, the system adjusts the volume: closing the thumb and index finger lowers the volume, while opening them increases it. This interactive application showcases real-time hand gesture recognition for practical control mechanisms. The code is available for exploration in this GitHub repository.
