This project involves training multiple models on Stanfordâ€™s car dataset to classify various car types.

The models include 10 ResNet50s with different parameters and preprocessing techniques, as well as an InceptionV2 model. The project explores the impact of different architectures and configurations on performance. The code and images are available in this GitHub repository.
